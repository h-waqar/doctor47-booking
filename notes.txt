1) At this moment the form is not using ajax so if payment will fail the customer will need to fillout the whole form
2) plugin is using legacy payment API (not the latest red flag credits card sumbit to server)
3) the prices should dynamic and easily changeable from admin
4) On booking their is mainly one information that we are repeating price + service we can display some more information i.e selected island customer location etc so he can confirm what selection he makes + summary will look good 
5) on Mobile device left side spacing and right side spacing in the form not equalant
6) Need to add strict validation on *Contact Number* Input field
7) Like there is small description in first label *Personal Information* there should be also same description in other steps for a smooth UX
8) On Card input fields there are no icons at the moment like medical protection booking plugin 
9) On step two when it select a wrong service it display JS alert
There are some points i personally noticed
